This R package downloads a random Project Gutenberg book.  Any text
downloaded in this way, therefore, is subject to the Project
Gutenberg License.  The condensed version is:

* You may only distribute verbatim copies of the ebooks. No changes 
  are allowed to the ebook contents. (Though reformatting the ebook 
  to a different file format is considered okay).
* If you charge money for the copies you distribute, you have to 
  pay royalties to Project Gutenberg.
* You must refund your clients for defective copies or if they 
  don't agree with the Project Gutenberg license.
