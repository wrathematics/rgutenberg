What is this?
====================================================================
This R package downloads a random Project Gutenberg book.  The 
purpose of this package is to offer for text, via the rgutenberg()
function, somewhat similar functionality to that of rnorm(), runif(), 
etc.  This functionality is really meant for developers who need
quick access to random corpora for developing and testing methods
that operate on text.  It is not meant to be used as an automated
way of downloading large portions of the Project Gutenberg corpora;
that would be insane.  Please also be considerate to their servers
and don't abuse this functionality.



How do I install it?
====================================================================
To install the package from github, I recommend using Hadley Wickham's
devtools package, which you can get from the CRAN.  After installing that,
you can enter

library(devtools)
install_github(username="wrathematics", repo="rgutenberg")

into an R terminal to install this package.  See the manual and demos
for an explanation of usage.



Anything else I should know?
====================================================================
Any text downloaded in this way is subject to the Project Gutenberg 
license.  The condensed version (taken from the Project Gutenberg 
site) is:

* You may only distribute verbatim copies of the ebooks. No changes 
  are allowed to the ebook contents. (Though reformatting the ebook 
  to a different file format is considered okay).
* If you charge money for the copies you distribute, you have to 
  pay royalties to Project Gutenberg.
* You must refund your clients for defective copies or if they 
  don't agree with the Project Gutenberg license. 

If you wish to read the full license, you may do so by visiting:

http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_Project_Gutenberg_License#Using_the_Project_Gutenberg_Trademark

or by entering the command pg.license() into R.


Neither the package author, nor the package itself, has any 
affiliation with Project Gutenberg.
